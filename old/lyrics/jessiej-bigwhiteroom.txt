Sitting in a big white room alone
Tilt my head back, feel the tears fall down
Close my eyes to see in the dark
I feel young, broken, so so scared (mmmmmm)
I don't wanna be here anymore
I wanna be somewhere else
Normal and free, like I used to be (oh)
But I have to stay in this big white room
With little old me

I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine

Sitting in a big white room alone
Close the door
Don't want the pain to come in (no no no no no no)
I clench my fist
And try to stay strong
I cry, feel sick
My heart is beating, b-b-beating, beating out of control
Can I run, run faster than you
I wanna feel my body again
Feel the wind in my hair, yeah

But I have to stay in this big white room
'Cause no one else cares (no no no no no no no oh)

I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine

Everybody's looking at me
Everybody's staring at me
What do I do now
Smile, yeah, yeah
Everybody's looking at me
Everybody's staring at me
What do I do now
Smile, yeah, yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh yeah oh

I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine

I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine
I'm going crazy
I'm losing my mind
I'm going crazy
In this big white room of mine
