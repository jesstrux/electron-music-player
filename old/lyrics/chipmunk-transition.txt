[Intro]
Yeah,
Yeah,
Whats he gunna say?

[Verse 1] 
You wanna be like me son get a chnage of plan,
I don't hardly see my dawgs, get a hand, pick ma fam
Confused, feelin used, tryin to rearrange plans,
Coz I've got a rolex but no time on my hands, 
Made a transition from a boy into a man,
Step one never mix ya business and fam,
Haters say I changed,
But I cant disagree,
Coz the figures damn skippy ain't the same in the bank, and I just wanna say thanks,
To those tryin to pull me down,
I was born to be fly I don't like the ground, so don't tell me stay grounded,
I'm good in my town,
And when I was blue you just went around.
I shouldn't know stress at my age,
Money came around me then everybody
Changed,
Fools say they know me from yay dawgs, stop tryin to call me by my government name

Cor its all chipmunk now,
You can blow after,
Its chipmunk now,
Its chipmunks time,
Chipmunks in his prime,
And only chipmunk can take chipmunks shine!

[Chorus]
I made a transition,
I made a transition.
You can say I made a transition.

[Verse 2]
I'm feelin like I found myself but lost my mind,
They wanna take my life I take my time,
I'm hair and flesh but lost my life my privacy went up in the sky,
When I signed I,
Grinned to six figures then I grin teeth airing all the tag alongs like bring me,
I never breaded noone when I was working,
So hate me if you want but don't say I don't deserve it,
Understand the position I played then,
Understand the transition I made then, go and picture me back in the days then,
Look at me now and get mad,
They just wanna get fly although now I'm jet lagged,
Now everybody step back,
I'm on the next ting,
Its not a bless ting,
They're number 2,
I'm on some next shit,
First place that's the first bace, suicide that's the worst case,
That's when you're whole life time is tryin to get your dough up,
And then you blow up and blow up,
No escalators, stairs, and I'm still tryin to step up,
But I think its tryin to handle the pressure,
I cant let the game slip away,
When the UK routes for my name,
Shame. 

Its all MR. Monk now,
You can blow after,
Its MR. Monk now,
Its MR. Monks Time,
MR. Monks in his prime,
And only MR. Monk can take MR. Monks shine! 

[Chorus] 

I made a transition,
I made a transition,
You can say I made a transition. 

[Verse 3]
Being succesful, that's a gift and a curse,
Being paid or being broke I know whats worse,
And people at the bottom say that,
You forgot you're roots but,
That's always the case when you rise from the dirt,
And preparation is the key to elevation,
But them man are too busy hating debating,
If I sound better on some grime shit,
Half of them don't even know what grime is,
Its all timing, even though I blew quicker than you're average,
I came through slicker than you're average,
Coz yeah I'm not you're average spitter,
Any tempo or instrumental,
Flows mentos straight jacket worthy, conspiracy they put in to merc me,
If I'm not fire how could you burn me,
Insultin how could you out me,
I'm so truth how could you doubt me,
Allow me. 

Cor its all me now,
You can blow after,
Its all me now,
Its all me time,
Its all me in my prime,
And only I can take my shine! 

(yeah, yeah) (yeah, yeah) (You can say I made a transition) (ha ha ha) (eh)
