You are overbearing; I'm not in love
But I don't wanna tell you
We've been contemplating how to give it up
But I can't convince you
We've been hopelessly holding too tight
When we don't even need to
And as the water fills this sinking ship
I know we have to leave too

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah

Said I'm moving on, cause things were getting rough
But here I am in your bed
I strung it on too long, afraid to be alone
Now we're in over our heads
It's either sink or swim, we've tried so many times
For worse or for better
It tears my heart in two to leave it all behind
And say goodbye forever

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah

Oh, you gotta let me leave
Oh, the weight will make us sink
Oh, could you please help me leave?
Oh, abandon ship with me

Mayday, mayday
This is an emergency
Mayday, mayday
You've gotta let me leave
I'm laying here, inches away
But you can't hear me call mayday

Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
Mayday, mayday (You are overbearing; I'm not in love)
(But I don't wanna tell you)
