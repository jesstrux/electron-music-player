Try so hard to get away<br />Think about you every day<br />Try so hard to live without<br />But no, no mas<br />Sun shine is shining far away<br />Birds eyes just looking out<br />And they can see that you're, you're mine<br /><br />'Cause when we're together, your love is controlling my brain<br />Like plunging inside of that fire I cannot contain<br /><br />Our love is a heatwave<br />It's burning through the evening rain<br />Sets sail out on an ocean wave<br />'Cause our love is like a heatwave<br />
