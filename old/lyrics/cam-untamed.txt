When they roll up Main Street in this town
We hook up and we roll out
All together, all alone
They run out, so bring your own
Leave behind your daddy's rules
And all that stuff you learned in school
It's alright, it's all good
What goes all around this burning wood

Cause it's all about us
And the music's loud
Where it gets hotter when the sun goes down (down, down, down)

Making memory lane out of old back roads
That spot in the woods where the cops don't go
Live for a while, for whatever feels good
In the moment, on the river, rock the chain
Untamed

Once we break that moonshine out
We do things we won't live down
Dancing on the Chevy hood
Think you won't? I bet you would
Find somebody you ain't with
Steal away and steal a kiss
Hang your clothes up on a limb
Grab a rope and swing on in

And now, don't you be shy
No, your mama won't see
Claire's all about being what we really wanna be (free, free, free)

Making memory lane out of old back roads
That spot in the woods where the cops don't go
Live for a while, for whatever feels good
In the moment, on the river, rock the chain
Untamed

Wild at heart ain't hard to find
Just pass the "no trespassing" sign
Turn there where we cut the wire
Look for smoke and there's the fire
Them ruts we made'll get you here
This is where we disappear
Come get your fill of living for a change
Untamed, yeah
Untamed

Making memory lane out of old back roads
That spot in the woods where the cops don't go
Live for a while, for whatever feels good
In the moment, on the river, rock the chain
Untamed
