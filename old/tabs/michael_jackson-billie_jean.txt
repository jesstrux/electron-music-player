[Verse]

<span>F#m</span>       
  She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
                                                     <span>Bm</span>
  I said don`t mind but what do you mean,I am the one  
                                        <span>F#m</span>                        
  Who will dance on the floor in the round
                     <span>Bm</span>            
  She said I am the one
                                          <span>F#m</span> 
  Who will dance on the floor in the round?  
             <span>F#m</span> 
  She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene.
             <span>F#m</span> 
  Then ev`ry head turned with eyes that dreamed
                 <span>Bm</span>
  Of being the one,
                                        <span>F#m</span>
  Who will dance on the floor in the round


[Pre-Chorus]
                   
  <span>D</span>                           <span>F#m</span>
  People always told me, be careful what you do.
  <span>D</span>                                             <span>F#m</span>
  And don`t go around breaking young girls&apos; hearts
     <span>D</span>                          <span>F#m</span>
  And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
          <span>D</span>                              <span>C#(7)</span>
  And be careful what you do, `cause the lie becomes the truth, hey


[Chorus]

<span>F#m</span>        
  Billie Jean is not my lover,
                                               <span>Bm</span>
  She&apos;s just a girl who claims that I am the one
                          <span>F#m</span>
  But the kid is not my son  
                      <span>Bm</span> 
  She says I am the one,
                         <span>F#m</span> 
  But the kid is not my son               
 

[Verse]

<span>F#m</span>   
For forty days and forty nights, law was on her side
                                                     <span>Bm</span>
But who can stand when she`s in demand,
                                        <span>F#m</span>   
Her scemes and plans
                     <span>Bm</span>       
`Cause we danced on the floor in the round.
                                          <span>F#m</span> 
So take my strong advice: Just remember to always think twice
      <span>F#m</span> 
She told my baby we danced till three, and she looked at me,
      <span>F#m</span> 
Then showed a photo. My baby cried.
                 <span>Bm</span>
His eyes were like mine.
                                        <span>F#m</span>
Can we dance on the floor in the round?


[Pre-Chorus]
                   
  <span>D</span>                           <span>F#m</span>
  People always told me, be careful what you do.
  <span>D</span>                                             <span>F#m</span>
  And don`t go around breaking young girls&apos; hearts
     <span>D</span>                          <span>F#m</span>
  And mother always told me, be careful who you love,
          <span>D</span>                              <span>C#(7)</span>
  And be careful what you do, `cause the lie becomes the truth, hey
