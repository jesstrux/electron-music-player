[Verse 1]

<span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>            <span>G</span>
I&apos;m waking up to ash and dust
          <span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust
             <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
I&apos;m breathing in the chemicals
<span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>            <span>G</span>                 <span>D</span>
I&apos;m breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
<span>Am</span>        <span>C</span>              <span>G</span>    
This is it, the apocalypse
<span>D</span>
Whoa


[Chorus 1]

<span>D</span>              <span>Am</span>             <span>C</span>
I&apos;m waking up, I feel it in my bones
<span>G</span>                  <span>D</span>
Enough to make my systems blow
<span>Am</span>                     <span>C</span>
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
<span>G</span>                      <span>D</span>
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Whoa, whoa, I&apos;m radioactive, radioactive
<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Whoa, whoa, I&apos;m radioactive, radioactive


[Verse 2]

<span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>            <span>G</span>
I raise my flags, don my clothes
          <span>D</span>                    <span>Am</span>
It&apos;s a revolution, I suppose
              <span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>
We&apos;re painted red to fit right in
<span>D</span>
Whoa
<span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>            <span>G</span>                 <span>D</span>
I&apos;m breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus
<span>Am</span>        <span>C</span>              <span>G</span>    
This is it, the apocalypse
<span>D</span>
Whoa


[Chorus 2]

<span>D</span>              <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>
I&apos;m waking up, I feel it in my bones
<span>G</span>                  <span>D</span>
Enough to make my systems blow
<span>Am</span>                     <span>C</span>
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
<span>G</span>                      <span>D</span>
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Whoa, whoa, I&apos;m radioactive, radioactive
<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Whoa, whoa, I&apos;m radioactive, radioactive


[Bridge]

<span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>   <span>G</span>           <span>D</span>
All systems go, sun hasn&apos;t died
<span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>             <span>D</span>
Deep in my bones, straight from inside


[Chorus 3]

<span>D</span>              <span>Am</span>             <span>C</span>
I&apos;m waking up, I feel it in my bones
<span>G</span>                  <span>D</span>
Enough to make my systems blow
<span>Am</span>                     <span>C</span>
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
<span>G</span>                      <span>D</span>
Welcome to the new age, to the new age
<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Whoa, whoa, I&apos;m radioactive, radioactive
<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Whoa, whoa, I&apos;m radioactive, radioactive
