[Verse 1]


<span>Am</span>             <span>D6</span>
Watch the sunrise
              <span>F</span>  
Say your goodbyes
       <span>E7</span>
Off we go


<span>Am</span>            <span>D6</span>
Some conversion
             <span>F</span>
No contemplation
          <span>E7</span>
Hit the road


<span>Am</span>          <span>D6</span>
Car overheats
               <span>F</span>
Jump out of my seat
                     <span>E7</span>
On the side of the highway baby


<span>Am</span>           <span>D6</span>
Our road is long
                 <span>F</span>
Your hold is strong
                   <span>E7</span>
Please don&apos;t ever let go oh no


[Chorus]

<span>Am</span>                 <span>B</span>
I know I don&apos;t know you
           <span>Gm7</span>
But I want you 
    <span>Am7</span>
so bad
<span>Am</span>                <span>B</span>               
Everyone has a secret
                 <span>Gm7</span>
Oh can they keep it
              <span>E</span>
Oh no they can&apos;t


[Verse 2]

<span>Am</span>             <span>D6</span>
I&apos;m driveing fast now
                 <span>F</span>
Don&apos;t think I know how 
       <span>E7</span>
to go slow

<span>Am</span>           <span>D6</span>
Where you at now
          <span>F</span>
I feel around
         <span>E7</span>
There you are

<span>Am</span>       
Cool these engines, Calm these jets
                  <span>D6</span>
I ask you how hot can get it
                     <span>F</span>
And as you wipe off beads of sweat
                        <span>E7</span>
Slowly you said &quot;I&apos;m not there yet&quot;


[Chorus]

<span>Am</span>                 <span>B</span>
I know I don&apos;t know you
           <span>Gm7</span>
But I want you 
     <span>Am7</span>
so bad
<span>Am</span>                <span>B</span>               
Everyone has a secret
                 <span>D6</span>
Oh can they keep it
              <span>E</span>
Oh no they can&apos;t
