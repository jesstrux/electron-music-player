                        WAYFARING  STRANGER
                            JOHNNY CASH

[Intro]  

<span>Am</span>  <span>Dm</span>  <span>E</span>  <span>Am</span>


[Verse]

<span>Am</span>
I&apos;m just a poor

Wayfaring stranger
             <span>Dm</span>
Travelling through
             <span>Am</span>
This world below

There is no sickness

No toil, nor danger
                <span>Dm</span>
In that bright land
<span>E</span>           <span>Am</span>
 To which i go

 
[Chorus]

            <span>F</span>
I&apos;m going there
           <span>C</span>
To see my father
            <span>F</span>
And all my loved ones
            <span>E</span>  <span>E7</span> <span>E</span>
Who&apos;ve gone on
          <span>Am</span>
I&apos;m just going over jordan
         <span>Dm</span>  <span>E</span>       <span>Am</span>
I&apos;m just going over home


[Instrumental]

<span>Am</span>  <span>Dm</span>  <span>E</span>  <span>Am</span>      <span>Am</span>  <span>Dm</span>  <span>E</span>  <span>Am</span>


[Verse]

<span>Am</span>
I know dark clouds

Will gather round me
          <span>Dm</span> 
I know my way
             <span>Am</span>
Is hard and steep

But beautious fields

Arise before me
            <span>Dm</span> 
Where god redeems
<span>Em</span>            <span>Am</span>
There vigils keep


[Chorus]

            <span>F</span>
I&apos;m going there
           <span>C</span>
To see my mother
                <span>F</span>
She said she&apos;d meet me
        <span>E</span>  <span>E7</span> <span>E</span>
When I come
          <span>Am</span>
I&apos;m just going over jordan
         Dm  E       Am  (end dead on this chord)
I&apos;m just going over home
