Mayday by Cam
Capo on 4th


[Verse 1]

<span>Am</span>       <span>F</span>              <span>C</span>
You are overbearing; I&apos;m not in love
<span>G</span>
But I don&apos;t wanna tell you
<span>Am</span>           <span>F</span>           <span>C</span>
We&apos;ve been contemplating how to give it up
<span>G</span>
But I can&apos;t convince you
<span>Am</span>           <span>F</span>        <span>C</span>
We&apos;ve been hopelessly holding too tight
<span>G</span>
When we don&apos;t even need to
<span>Am</span>            <span>F</span>            <span>C</span>
And as the water fills this sinking ship
<span>G</span>
I know we have to leave too


[Chorus]

<span>C</span>  <span>F</span>     <span>Am</span>   <span>F</span>
Oh       Oh
<span>C</span>           <span>G</span>
Mayday, mayday
<span>Am</span>          <span>F</span> 
This is an emergency
<span>C</span>       <span>G</span>
Mayday, mayday
<span>Am</span>                  <span>F</span> 
You&apos;ve gotta let me leave
<span>F</span>          <span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>
I&apos;m lying here, inches away
   <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>                   <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>F</span> 
But you can&apos;t hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah


[Verse 2]

<span>Am</span>         <span>F</span>               <span>C</span>
Said I&apos;m moving on, cause things were getting rough
<span>G</span>
But here I am in your bed
<span>Am</span>          <span>F</span>            <span>C</span>
I strung it on too long, afraid to be alone
<span>G</span>
Now we&apos;re in over our heads
<span>Am</span>            <span>F</span>           <span>C</span>
It&apos;s either sink or swim, we&apos;ve tried so many times
<span>G</span>
For worse or for better
<span>Am</span>            <span>F</span>           <span>C</span>
It tears my heart in two to leave it all behind
<span>G</span>
And say goodbye forever


[Chorus]

<span>C</span> <span>F</span>     <span>Am</span> <span>F</span>
Oh      Oh
<span>C</span>       <span>G</span>
Mayday, mayday
<span>Am</span>           <span>F</span>
This is an emergency
<span>C</span>       <span>G</span>
Mayday, mayday
<span>Am</span>                  <span>F</span>
You&apos;ve gotta let me leave
<span>F</span>         <span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>
I&apos;m lying here, inches away
   <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>                  <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>    <span>F</span>
But you can&apos;t hear me call mayday, yeah, yeah


[Bridge]

<span>Am</span>     <span>G</span>           <span>F</span>
Oh, you gotta let me leave
<span>F</span>       <span>Am</span>                   <span>C</span>
Oh, the weight will make us sink
<span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>           <span>F</span>
Oh, could you please help me leave?
<span>Am</span>              <span>C</span>
Oh, abandon ship with me


[Chorus]

<span>C</span>       <span>G</span>
Mayday, mayday
<span>Am</span>           <span>F</span>
This is an emergency
<span>C</span>       <span>G</span>
Mayday, mayday
<span>Am</span>                  <span>F</span>
You&apos;ve gotta let me leave
<span>F</span>         <span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>
I&apos;m lying here, inches away
   <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>                  <span>C</span>     
But you can&apos;t hear me call maydaY
