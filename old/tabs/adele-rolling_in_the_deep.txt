[Intro]

<span>C5</span>


[Verse 1]

<span>C5</span>               <span>G5</span>
There&apos;s a fire starting in my heart,
<span>Bb5</span>                                <span>G5</span>                 <span>Bb5</span>
Reaching a fever pitch and it&apos;s bringing me out the dark
<span>C5</span>              <span>G5</span>             
Finally, I can see you crystal clear.
<span>Bb5</span>                           <span>G5</span>                 <span>Bb5</span>  
Go ahead and sell me out and I&apos;ll lay your ship bare.

<span>C5</span>                     <span>G5</span>  
See how I leave, with every piece of you
<span>Bb5</span>                       <span>G5</span>                  <span>Bb5</span>
Don&apos;t underestimate the things that I will do.
<span>C5</span>                <span>G5</span>  
There&apos;s a fire starting in my heart,
<span>Bb5</span>                                <span>G5</span>                   <span>Bb5</span>
Reaching a fever pitch and it&apos;s bringing me out the dark


[Pre-Chorus 1]

<span>Ab</span>               <span>Bb</span>                      <span>Gm</span>   
    The scars of your love, remind me of us.
               <span>Ab</span>                           <span>Ab</span>   
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             <span>Bb</span>                        <span>Gm</span>      
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
              <span>G</span>
I can&apos;t help feeling...


[Chorus]

                     <span>Cm</span>                   <span>Bb</span>
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
                <span>Ab</span>                                           
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
      <span>Bb</span>                                <span>Cm</span>           <span>Bb</span>
Your had my heart... (I wish you)... Inside of your hand (Never had met me)
           <span>Ab</span>                                                                   <span>Bb</span>
And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)


[Verse 2]

<span>C5</span>               <span>G5</span>
Baby I have no story to be told,
<span>Bb5</span>                                <span>G5</span>                  <span>Bb5</span>
But I&apos;ve heard one of you and I&apos;m gonna make your head burn.
<span>C5</span>                   <span>G5</span>
Think of me in the depths of your despair.
<span>Bb5</span>                          <span>G5</span>                  <span>Bb5</span>
Making a home down there, as mine sure won&apos;t be shared.


[Pre-Chorus 1]

<span>Ab</span>               <span>Bb</span>                      <span>Gm</span>   
    The scars of your love, remind me of us.
               <span>Ab</span>                           <span>Ab</span>   
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
             <span>Bb</span>                        <span>Gm</span>      
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
              <span>G</span>
I can&apos;t help feeling...


[Chorus]
                     <span>Cm</span>                   <span>Bb</span>
We could have had it all... (I wish you, never had met me)...
                <span>Ab</span>                                           
Rolling in the Deep (Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
      <span>Bb</span>                                <span>Cm</span>           <span>Bb</span>

And you played it... (Tears are gonna fall)... To the beat (Rolling in the deep)
                      <span>Ab</span>       <span>Bb</span>
We could have had it all 
                 <span>Cm</span>       <span>Bb</span>
Rolling in the Deep 
                   <span>Ab</span>                                    
Your had my heart Inside of your hand 
         <span>Bb</span> 
And you played it To the beat 


[Verse 3]

N.C.
Throw yourself through ever open door (Whoa)
N.C.
Count your blessings to find what look for (Whoa-uh)
<span>C5</span>
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold (Whoa)
<span>C5</span>
And pay me back in kind- You reap just what you sow.


[Pre-Chorus 2]

   <span>Ab</span>
It all. (Tears are gonna fall)
                            
It all, It all (Rolling in the deep)
