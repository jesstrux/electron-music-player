[Intro]

<span>Am</span>     <span>Dm</span>


[Verse]

<span>Am</span>
I don&apos;t know if you were looking at me or not, You probably smile like that all the time 
                                                          <span>Dm</span>
And I don&apos;t mean to bother you but I couldn&apos;t just walk by, And not say hi
<span>Am</span>
And I know your name, &apos;cause everybody in here knows your name, 

And you&apos;re not looking for anything right now
                               <span>Dm</span>
So I don&apos;t wanna come on strong, But don&apos;t get me wrong Your eyes are so intimidating
<span>Am</span>
My heart is pounding but, It&apos;s just a conversation, No girl I&apos;m not gunna waste it
                 <span>Dm</span>
You don&apos;t know me, I don&apos;t know you but I want to 


[Chorus]

<span>C</span>                                 <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t wanna steal your freedom, I don&apos;t wanna change your mind
<span>Am</span>                                <span>F</span>
I don&apos;t have to make you love me, I just want to take your time 
<span>C</span>                                <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t wanna wreck your Friday, I ain&apos;t gunna waste my lies
<span>Am</span>                               <span>F</span>
I don&apos;t have to take your heart, I just wanna take your time 


[Verse 2]

<span>Am</span>
And I know it starts with hello, And the next thing you know you&apos;re trying to be nice

And some guys getting too close
                     <span>Dm</span>
Tryin to pick you up, Trying to get you drunk
<span>Am</span>
And I&apos;m sure one of your friends is about to come over here

Cuz she&apos;s supposed to save you from random guys 
                                          <span>Dm</span>
That talk to much and wanna stay too long, It&apos;s the same old song and dance but I think you know it 
well
<span>Am</span>
You coulda rolled your eyes, Told me to go to hell, Coulda walked away
                   <span>Dm</span>
But your still here, And I&apos;m still here, Come on let&apos;s see where it goes


[Chorus]

<span>C</span>                                 <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t wanna steal your freedom, I don&apos;t wanna change your mind
<span>Am</span>                                <span>F</span>
I don&apos;t have to make you love me, I just wanna take your time
<span>C</span>                                 <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t have to meet your mother, We don&apos;t have to cross that line
<span>Am</span>                               <span>F</span>                            <span>Am</span>
I don&apos;t wanna steal your covers, I just wanna take your time


[Bridge]

<span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>F</span>
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa

I don&apos;t wanna go home with you
<span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>F</span>
Whoa, Whoa, Whoa
                <span>G</span>
I just wanna be alone with you


[Chorus]

<span>C</span>                                 <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t wanna steal your freedom, I don&apos;t wanna change your mind
<span>Am</span>                                <span>F</span>
I don&apos;t have to make you love me, I just wanna take your time
<span>C</span>                                 <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t wanna blow your phone up, I just wanna blow your mind
<span>Am</span>                                <span>F</span>
I don&apos;t have to take your heart, I just wanna take your time 
<span>C</span>                                <span>Em</span>
No, I ain&apos;t gotta call you baby, And I ain&apos;t gotta call you mine
<span>Am</span>                               <span>F</span>
I don&apos;t have to take your heart, I just wanna take your time
