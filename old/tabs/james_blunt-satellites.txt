<span>E</span> <span>F#</span> <span>G#m</span> <span>B</span>
<span>E</span> <span>F#</span> <span>G#m</span> <span>G#m</span>

== Verse 1 ==
       <span>E</span>           <span>F#</span>               <span>G#m</span>      <span>B</span>
She&apos;s a-another victim of life we&apos;ve come to know
    <span>E</span>         <span>F#</span>
Technology, celebrity
        <span>G#m</span>                   <span>B</span>
All the things you cannot hold

             <span>E</span>                       <span>F#</span>
She&apos;s from a long lost tribe looking for the light
     <span>G#m</span>                <span>B</span>
or a friend to hold her hand
      <span>E</span>         <span>F#</span>       <span>G#m</span> 
She&apos;s doing the best she can

== Pre-chorus ==
           <span>E</span>           <span>B</span>
Seems that everyone we know&apos;s
          <span>E</span>            <span>B</span>
Out there waiting by a phone
          <span>E</span>              <span>B</span>             <span>F#</span>
Wondering why they feel alone, in this life

== Chorus ==
<span>E</span>       <span>F#</span>           <span>G#m</span>
 Are we all just satellites?
            <span>B</span>               <span>E</span>  
Where&apos;s the love, show me tonight
           <span>F#</span>         <span>G#m</span>
Here&apos;s the moment we unite
      <span>B</span>         <span>E</span>
Oh-wa-oh, oh-wa-oh-oh

<span>E</span>       <span>F#</span>                  <span>G#m</span>
 All we know, life&apos;s just a dream
        <span>B</span>                   <span>E</span>
Who the hell knows what it means?
         <span>F#</span>                  <span>G#m</span>
Stop the world and sing with me
                <span>C#m</span>
oh-wa-oh, oh-wa-oh-oh

== Verse 2 ==
<span>E</span>        <span>F#</span>                 <span>G#m</span>         <span>B</span>
 All the memories have been experienced through
<span>E</span>               <span>F#</span>
High speed on a video screen
       <span>G#m</span>               <span>B</span>
That&apos;s all she ever knew
             <span>E</span>                    <span>F#</span>
Did you know none of it&apos;s real if you can&apos;t feel
    <span>G#m</span>                  <span>B</span>
the beating of someone&apos;s heart
    <span>E</span>         <span>F#</span>          <span>G#m</span>
Now leave yourself in the dark

== Pre-chorus ==
           <span>E</span>           <span>B</span>
Seems that everyone we know&apos;s
          <span>E</span>            <span>B</span>
Out there waiting by a phone
          <span>E</span>              <span>B</span>             <span>F#</span>
Wondering why they feel alone, in this life

Oh-wa-oh, oh-wa-oh-oh
