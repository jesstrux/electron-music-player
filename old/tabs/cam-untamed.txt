Intro
<span>B</span>    <span>A</span>


          <span>B</span>
When they roll up Main Street in this town

We hook up and we roll out
<span>E</span>
All together, all alone

They run out, so bring your own
<span>B</span>
Leave behind your daddy&apos;s rules

And all that stuff you learned in school
<span>E</span>
It&apos;s all right, it&apos;s all good

What goes all around this burning wood
<span>B</span>
&apos;Cause it&apos;s all about us

And the music&apos;s loud
<span>A</span>             <span>G</span>                        <span>B</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>G</span>     <span>B</span>
Where it gets hotter when the sun goes down, down, down, down


              <span>A</span>           <span>E</span>
Making memory lane out of old back roads
     <span>B</span>           <span>A</span>               <span>E</span> 
That spot in the woods where the cops don&apos;t go
<span>B</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
Live for a while, for whatever feels good
       <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>
In the moment, on the river, rock the chain
  <span>B</span>       
Untamed

<span>B</span>
Once we break that moonshine out

We do things we won&apos;t live down
<span>E</span>
Dancing on the Chevy hood

Think you won&apos;t, I bet you would

<span>B</span>
Find somebody you ain&apos;t with

Steal away and steal a kiss
<span>E</span>
Hang your clothes up on a limb

Grab a rope and swing on in
<span>B</span>
And now, don&apos;t you be shy
                    <span>E</span>
No, your mama won&apos;t see
                   <span>B</span>                             <span>D</span>     <span>E</span>     <span>B</span>   
Claire&apos;s all about being what we really wanna be free, free, free


              <span>A</span>           <span>E</span>
Making memory lane out of old back roads
     <span>B</span>           <span>A</span>               <span>E</span> 
That spot in the woods where the cops don&apos;t go
<span>B</span>          <span>A</span>          <span>E</span>
Live for a while, for whatever feels good
       <span>G</span>              <span>A</span>
In the moment, on the river, rock the chain
  <span>B</span>       
Untamed


<span>A</span>    <span>E</span>


<span>A</span>                   <span>E</span>
Wild at heart ain&apos;t hard to find
                  <span>G</span>
Just pass the &quot;no trespassing&quot; sign
<span>A</span>                   <span>E</span>
Turn there where we cut the wire
                   <span>D</span>
Look for smoke and there&apos;s the fire
     <span>A</span>               <span>E</span>
Them ruts we made&apos;ll get you here
<span>D</span>
This is where we disappear
     <span>G</span>                             <span>A</span>
Come get your fill of living for a change
  <span>B</span>
Untamed, yeah
