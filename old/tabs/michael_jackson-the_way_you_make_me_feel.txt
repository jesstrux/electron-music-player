[Intro]

<span>F#</span>  <span>E</span>
<span>F#</span>  <span>E</span>
<span>F#</span>  <span>E</span>
<span>F#</span>  <span>E</span>


[Verse 1]

<span>F#</span>             <span>E</span>                 <span>F#</span>             <span>E</span>
Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
<span>F#</span>              <span>E</span>                  <span>F#</span>      <span>E</span>
You give me fever like Ive never, ever known
<span>F#</span>              <span>E</span>                <span>F#</span>           <span>E</span>
Youre just a product of loveliness
<span>F#</span>           <span>E</span>                   <span>F#</span>     
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress


[Pre-Chorus]

<span>B</span>              <span>A</span>
I feel your fever
        <span>B</span>        <span>A</span>
From miles around
<span>B</span>              <span>A</span>             <span>B</span>              <span>C#</span>
Ill pick you up in my car and well paint the town
<span>F#</span>           <span>E</span>               <span>F#</span>          <span>E</span>
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
<span>F#</span>                   <span>E</span>          <span>F#</span>    <span>E</span>
That youre the one for me


[Chorus]
(keep repeating <span>F#</span> <span>E</span>)

The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone


[Verse 2]

<span>F#</span>          <span>E</span>                 <span>F#</span>    <span>E</span>

<span>F#</span>                <span>E</span>           <span>F#</span>      <span>E</span>
Just hold me baby and im in ecstasy
<span>F#</span>          <span>E</span>               <span>F#</span>        <span>E</span>
Oh Ill be workin from nine to five
<span>F#</span>              <span>E</span>           <span>F#</span>        
To buy you things to keep you by my side


[Pre-Chorus]

<span>B</span>        <span>A</span>            <span>B</span>        <span>A</span>
I never felt so in love before
<span>B</span>                 <span>A</span>               <span>B</span>             <span>C#</span>
Just promise baby, youll love me forevermore
<span>F#</span>           <span>E</span>               <span>F#</span>     <span>E</span>
I swear Im keepin you satisfied
<span>F#</span>                     <span>E</span>         <span>F#</span>     <span>E</span>
