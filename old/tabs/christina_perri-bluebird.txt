[Verse 1]
<span>C</span>      <span>Am</span>
How the hell does a broken heart
<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>
Get back together when it&apos;s torn apart?
<span>C</span>   <span>Am</span> <span>F</span>       <span>G</span>
 Teach itself to start beating again, ba ba ba ba

[Chorus]
<span>C</span>
This little bluebird
     <span>Am</span>
Came looking for you
    <span>F</span>
I said that I hadn&apos;t seen you
      <span>G</span>
In quite some time
<span>C</span>
This little bluebird
<span>Am</span>
She came looking again
  <span>F</span>
I said we weren&apos;t even friends
  <span>G</span>
She could have you

[Verse 2]
<span>Am</span> <span>Gm</span>
Don&apos;t you think it was hard?
  <span>C</span>     <span>F</span>
I didn&apos;t even say that you died
   <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>
It wouldn&apos;t have been such a lie
<span>F</span>   <span>Gm</span>
 Cause then I started to cry

[Chorus]
<span>C</span>
This little bluebird
    <span>Am</span>
Sure won&apos;t give it a rest
 <span>F</span>
She swears that you may be
     <span>G</span>
Better than all the rest
       <span>C</span>
I said no
       <span>Am</span>
You&apos;ve got it all wrong
   <span>F</span>
If he were something special
   <span>G</span>
I wouldn&apos;t have this song

[Verse 2]
<span>Am</span> <span>Gm</span>
Don&apos;t you think it was hard?
  <span>C</span>     <span>F</span>
I didn&apos;t even say that you died
   <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>
It wouldn&apos;t have been such a lie
<span>F</span>   <span>Em</span>   <span>Gm</span>
 Cause then I started to cry

[Verse 1]
<span>C</span>      <span>Am</span>
How the hell does a broken heart
<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>
Get back together when it&apos;s torn apart?
<span>C</span>   <span>Am</span> <span>F</span>
 Teach itself to start beating again
      <span>G</span>   <span>C</span>
Ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba

[Verse 3]
<span>F</span>        <span>Am</span>
What if when she comes over I am in your arms?
<span>F</span>     <span>C</span>
Taking all I want from you again
<span>C</span>         <span>Am</span>          <span>Fm</span>  <span>F</span>
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
<span>C</span>         <span>Am</span>          <span>Fm</span>  <span>G</span>
Ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba
<span>C</span>      <span>Am</span>
How the hell does a broken heart
<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>
Get back together when it&apos;s torn apart?
<span>C</span>   <span>Am</span> <span>F</span>       <span>G</span>
 Teach itself to start beating again, ba ba ba ba
<span>C</span>      <span>Am</span>
How the hell does a broken heart
<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>
Get back together when it&apos;s torn apart?
<span>C</span>   <span>Am</span> <span>F</span>       <span>G</span>
 Teach itself to start beating again, ba ba ba ba
<span>Fm</span>       <span>Gm</span>
Beating again, ba ba ba ba

[Outro]
<span>C</span>
This little bluebird
   <span>Am</span>
Don&apos;t come around here anymore
   <span>F</span>
So I went looking for her
      <span>G</span>   <span>C</span>
And I found you
