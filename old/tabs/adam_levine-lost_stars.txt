[Verse]

<span>F7</span>
Please don&apos;t see
<span>F7</span>
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
<span>F7</span>
Please see me
<span>F7</span>
Reaching out for someone I can see
<span>F7</span>         <span>Em</span>                              <span>F7</span>
Take my hand, let&apos;s see where we wake up tomorrow
            <span>Em</span>                                   <span>F7</span>
Best laid plans sometime are just a one night stand
         <span>Em</span>                                  <span>F7</span>
I&apos;ll be damned, cupid&apos;s demanding back his arrow
<span>G</span>                           <span>G</span>
So lets gets drunk on our tears


[Chorus]

<span>F7</span>                 <span>C</span>
God, tell us the reason
                        <span>F7</span>
Youth is wasted on the young
             <span>C</span>
It&apos;s hunting season
                         <span>F7</span>
And the lambs are on the run
               <span>C</span>
Searching for meaning
           <span>D</span>            <span>D</span>
But are we all lost stars
<span>Dm</span>                       <span>G</span>       
Trying to light up the dark?


[Verse]

<span>F7</span>
Who are we?
<span>F7</span>
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
<span>F7</span>
Woe is me 
<span>F7</span>
If we&apos;re not careful, turns into reality
<span>F7</span>         <span>Em</span>                              <span>F7</span>
Don&apos;t you dare, let our best memories bring you sorrow
            <span>Em</span>                                   <span>F7</span>
Yesterday, I saw a lion kiss a deer
         <span>Em</span>                                  <span>F7</span>
Turn the page, maybe we&apos;ll find a brand new ending
<span>G</span>                           <span>G</span>
Where we&apos;re dancing on our tears


[Chorus]

<span>F7</span>                 <span>C</span>
God, tell us the reason
                        <span>F7</span>
Youth is wasted on the young
             <span>C</span>
It&apos;s hunting season
                         <span>F7</span>
And the lambs are on the run
               <span>C</span>
Searching for meaning
           <span>D</span>            <span>D</span>
But are we all lost stars
<span>Dm</span>                       <span>G</span>       
Trying to light up the dark?


[Bridge]

<span>F7</span>                               <span>C</span>
I thought I saw you out there crying
<span>F7</span>                             <span>C</span>
I thought I heard you call my name
<span>F7</span>                                <span>C</span>
I thought I saw you out there crying
<span>G</span>               <span>F7</span>
Just the same, yeahhhhhhhhh


[Chorus]

<span>F7</span>                 <span>C</span>
God, tell us the reason
                        <span>F7</span>
Youth is wasted on the young
             <span>C</span>
It&apos;s hunting season
                         <span>F7</span>
And this lamb is on the run
               <span>C</span>
Searching for meaning
           <span>D</span>            <span>D</span>
But are we all lost stars
<span>Dm</span>                       <span>G</span>       
Trying to light up the dark?


[Bridge/Chorus]

<span>F7</span>                               <span>C</span>
I thought I saw you out there crying
<span>F7</span>                             <span>C</span>
I thought I heard you call my name
<span>F7</span>                                <span>C</span>
I thought I saw you out there crying
           <span>D</span>            <span>D</span>
But are we all lost stars
<span>Dm</span>                       <span>G</span>       
Trying to light up the dark?
