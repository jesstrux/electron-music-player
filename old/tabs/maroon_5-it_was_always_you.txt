[Intro]

<span>Db</span>   <span>B</span>   <span>F#</span>


[Verse]

<span>Db</span>                       <span>B</span>
Woke up sweating from a dream
                         <span>F#</span>
With a different kind of feeling
<span>Db</span>                       <span>B</span>
All day long my heat was beating
                  <span>F#</span>
Searching for the meaning
<span>Dbm</span>                   <span>B</span>
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
                <span>F#</span>
We were just wasting time
<span>Dbm</span>          
For my whole life
         <span>B</span>
We never crossed the line
             <span>F#</span>
Only friends in my mind

But now I realize


[Pre-Chorus]

             <span>Dbm</span>
It was always you
                <span>B</span>                         <span>F#</span>
Can&#x2019;t believe I could not see it all this time

All this time
              <span>Dbm</span>
It was always you
               <span>B</span>                       <span>F#</span>
Now I know why my heart wasn&#x2019;t satisfied

Satisfied


[Chorus]

              <span>Dbm</span>    <span>B</span>
It was always you
   <span>F#</span>
You
                 <span>Dbm</span>
No more guessing who
                  <span>B</span>                    <span>F#</span>
Looking back now, I know it was always you

Always you


[Verse]

<span>Db</span>              <span>B</span>                  <span>F#</span>
All my hidden desires finally came alive
<span>Db</span>               <span>B</span>
No I never told a lie, to you
             <span>F#</span>
So why would I start tonight
<span>Dbm</span>                   <span>B</span>
Hazel eyes, I was so color blind
             <span>F#</span>
We were just wasting time
<span>Dbm</span>
For my whole life
         <span>B</span>
We never crossed the line
              <span>F#</span>
Only friends in my mind

But now I realize


[Pre-Chorus]

             <span>Dbm</span>
It was always you
                <span>B</span>                         <span>F#</span>
Can&#x2019;t believe I could not see it all this time

All this time
              <span>Dbm</span>
It was always you
               <span>B</span>                       <span>F#</span>
Now I know why my heart wasn&#x2019;t satisfied

Satisfied


[Chorus]

              <span>Dbm</span>    <span>B</span>
It was always you
 <span>F#</span>
You
                 <span>Dbm</span>
No more guessing who
                  <span>B</span>                    <span>F#</span>
Looking back now, I know it was always you

Always you


[Bridge]

<span>Dbm</span>    <span>B</span>       <span>F#</span>                                           
Aaaaah, yeah, you, you, you, always you, you, you
<span>Dbm</span>    <span>B</span>       <span>F#</span>
Aaaaah, yeah, you, you, you, always you, you, you


[Verse]

<span>Db</span>                       <span>B</span>
Woke up sweating from a dream
                         <span>F#</span>
With a different kind of feeling


[Pre-Chorus]

             <span>Dbm</span>
It was always you
                <span>B</span>                         <span>F#</span>
Can&#x2019;t believe I could not see it all this time

All this time
              <span>Dbm</span>
It was always you
               <span>B</span>                       <span>F#</span>
Now I know why my heart wasn&#x2019;t satisfied

Satisfied


[Chorus]

              <span>Dbm</span>    <span>B</span>
It was always you
   <span>F#</span>
You
                 <span>Dbm</span>
No more guessing who
                  <span>B</span>                    <span>F#</span>
Looking back now, I know it was always you

Always you
              <span>Dbm</span>  <span>B</span>   <span>F#</span>
It was always you
