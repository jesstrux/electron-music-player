I love this song; it&apos;s a great example of artistic cussing. I play a ukulele so I&apos;m not 
familiar with guitar tabs. Here are the chords and some notes for picking.

INTRO:
chords: <span>G</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Em</span> <span>C</span> (x2)

       <span>G</span>              <span>Bm</span>
I am a pain in your ass
        <span>Em</span>                            <span>C</span>
And I&apos;m wondering how long it&apos;s gonna last
       <span>G</span>             <span>Bm</span>
Be my mirror, be my friend,
        <span>Em</span>
Be the workhouse of the energy
   <span>C</span>
I twist your arm to spin


REFRAIN:
     <span>A</span>                   <span>C</span>
Everyday, like a power station
             <span>G</span>          <span>Bm</span>
You know it isn&apos;t good
               <span>Em</span>               <span>G</span>
I know you&apos;re burning too much wood
              <span>C</span>
Oh, and you burn out
              <span>Bm</span>
The twisted irony is
                        <span>G</span>
Your ashes come home to me
             <span>Bm</span>
(Come home to me) <-- lyrics="" second="" time="" only="" <span="">Em      <span>C</span>
Come home to me

             <span>G</span>
So we take a walk
              <span>Bm</span>
To make some sense
        <span>Em</span>                          <span>C</span>
And I&apos;m wondering if you fancy my advance
       <span>G</span>
I have pushed you
        <span>Bm</span>
Way too far
            <span>Em</span>
And you say Fuck you little princess
         <span>C</span>
Who the hell do you think you are?


REPEAT REFRAIN

<span>G</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Em</span> <span>C</span>
                                  <span>G</span>
Yeah well your ashes come home to me
             <span>Bm</span>
Come home to me
             <span>Em</span>
Come home to me
             <span>C</span>                                          <span>G</span>
Cos no other sucker&apos;s gonna have you on a fucking mantelpiece
          <span>Bm</span>
The mantelpiece
           <span>Em</span>         <span>C</span>
The mantelpiece

ENDING: (with picking)
<span>G</span> <span>Bm</span> <span>Em</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span></-->
