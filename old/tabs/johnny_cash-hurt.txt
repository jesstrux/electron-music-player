[Intro]

<span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>


[Verse 1]

<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>       <span>C</span>      <span>D</span>       <span>Am</span>
   I hurt myself today   to see if I still feel
<span>C</span>       <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>        <span>Am</span>
I focus on the pain   the only thing that&apos;s real
<span>C</span>        <span>D</span>        <span>Am</span>          <span>C</span>      <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>
The needle tears a hole   the old familiar sting
     <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>           <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>       <span>G</span>          
Try to kill it all away   but I remember everything


[Chorus]

<span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>     <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
<span>Am</span>          <span>F</span>             <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    <span>Am</span>                 <span>F</span>    <span>G</span>               <span>G</span>
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
<span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>      <span>G</span>                <span>Am</span>
I will let you down    I will make you hurt


[Transition]

<span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>


[Verse 2]

<span>Am</span>   <span>C</span>         <span>D</span>        <span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>      <span>D</span>     <span>Am</span>
   I wear this crown of thorns   upon my liars chair
<span>C</span>          <span>D</span>        <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>Am</span>
Full of broken thoughts   I cannot repair
<span>C</span>           <span>D</span>         <span>Am</span>         <span>C</span>       <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>
Beneath the stains of time   the feeling disappears
<span>C</span>         <span>D</span>      <span>Am</span>    <span>C</span>     <span>D</span>     <span>G</span>
You are someone else   I am still right here


[Chorus 2]

<span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>     <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>
What have I become?     My sweetest friend
<span>Am</span>          <span>F</span>             <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>
Everyone I know  goes away in the end
    <span>Am</span>                 <span>F</span>    <span>G</span>            <span>G</span>
And you could have it all   My empire of dirt
<span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>               <span>G</span>
I will let you down   I will make you hurt
   <span>Am</span>               <span>F</span>     <span>G</span>              <span>G</span>
If I could start again  a million miles away
<span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>    <span>G</span>
I would keep myself  I would find a way
