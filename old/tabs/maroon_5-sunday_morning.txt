[Verse]
<span>Dm</span>     <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
Sunday morning rain is falling
<span>Dm</span>         <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
Steal some cover share some skin
<span>Dm</span>         <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable
    <span>Dm</span>               <span>G</span>              <span>C</span>
You twist to fit the mold that I am in
    <span>Dm</span>                 <span>G</span>            <span>C</span>
But things just get so crazy living live gets hard to do
            <span>Dm</span>             <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
And I would gladly hit the road get up and go if I knew
     <span>Dm</span>               <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
That someday it would lead me back to you
     <span>Dm</span>               <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
That someday it would lead me back to you


[Chorus]
            <span>Dm</span>  <span>G</span> <span>C</span>
That may be all I need
                   <span>Dm</span>  <span>G</span> <span>C</span>
In darkness she is all I see
                       <span>Dm</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
Now come and rest your bones with me
                       <span>Dm</span>            <span>G</span>             <span>C</span>
Driving slow on sunday morning and I never want to leave


[Verse]
<span>Dm</span>      <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
Fingers trace your every outline
<span>Dm</span>      <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
Paint a picture with my hands
<span>Dm</span>       <span>G</span>                  <span>C</span>
Back and forth we sway like branches in a storm
          <span>Dm</span>            <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
Change of weather still together when it ends


[Chorus]
            <span>Dm</span>  <span>G</span> <span>C</span>
That may be all I need
                   <span>Dm</span>  <span>G</span> <span>C</span>
In darkness she is all I see
                       <span>Dm</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
Now come and rest your bones with me
                       <span>Dm</span>            <span>G</span>             <span>C</span>
Driving slow on sunday morning and I never want to leave
