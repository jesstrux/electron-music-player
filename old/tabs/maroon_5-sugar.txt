[Verse]

<span>Db</span>                <span>Bbm7</span>                 
I&apos;m hurting baby, I&apos;m broken down
<span>Ebm7</span>                  <span>Db</span>       
I need your loving, loving
             
I need it now
<span>Db</span>                    
When I&apos;m without you
<span>Bbm7</span>                 
I&apos;m something weak
<span>Ebm7</span>                  <span>Db</span>        
You got me begging, begging
              
I&apos;m on my knee
<span>F#</span>                                <span>Bbm7</span> 
I don&apos;t wanna be needing your love
                                 <span>Ebm7</span>
I just wanna be deep in your love
                                  <span>Db</span>  
And it&apos;s killing me when you&apos;re away
          <span>F#</span>                                     <span>Bbm7</span> 
Ooh baby, cause I really don&apos;t care where you are
                                  <span>Ebm7</span>
I just wanna be there where you are
                              <span>Db</span>  
And I gotta get one little taste

Don&apos;t leave me hanging, hanging
                
Come get me some
<span>Db</span>                   
When I&apos;m without ya

So insecure
<span>Ebm7</span>                       <span>Db</span>

I just wanna be deep in your love
<span>Ebm7</span>                               <span>Db</span>     
And it&apos;s killing me when you&apos;re away
           <span>F#</span>                                  <span>Bbm7</span>
Ooh baby, cause I really don&apos;t care where you are
                                <span>Ebm7</span>

I don&apos;t gotta be afraid
<span>Ebm7</span>
