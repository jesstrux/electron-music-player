These chords are based off of his live version. I don&apos;t have tabs for the second guitar
part (which sounds
pretty cool) but these are the chords that Sam plays throughout the song.

Capo 4
<span>C</span> : x32033 (hammer on your index finger on the G string to play like him)
<span>G</span> : 320033 (hammer on your index finger on the A string)
<span>Em</span>: x22033
<span>D</span>:  x00233

[Verse 1]
<span>C</span>       <span>G</span>
We drove right past
<span>Em</span>     <span>D</span>
That no trespassing sign
<span>C</span>        <span>G</span>
We sat on the tailgate
<span>Em</span>         <span>D</span>
And watched the planes take off

We thought we had all night
There was no need to rush
That&apos;s when those cops
Came pulling up
And I thought
Man, ain&apos;t this some shhhh

[Pre-Chorus]
Your daddy&apos;s gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn&apos;t change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

-Repeat that progression the whole song as far as I can tell-
[Chorus]
But there was somethin&apos; &apos;bout the way
The blue lights were shinin&apos;
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Verse 2]
Man, they weren&apos;t playin&apos;
They sure put those cuffs on quick
You tried to sweet talk &apos;em
They didn&apos;t fall for it, but I did
You were on the left, I was on the right
I knew you didn&apos;t smoke
When you asked him for a light
And I laughed
He got mad and slammed the door

[Pre-Chorus]
I swear your daddy&apos;s gonna kill me
But if I survive tonight
I wouldn&apos;t change one thing
Baby, yeah
I know it sounds crazy

[Chorus]
But there was somethin&apos; &apos;bout the way
The blue lights were shinin&apos;
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
You were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back of a cop car

[Bridge]
And you were like (oh woah oh)
Side by side
And locked in tight
They were taking their time
But we didn&apos;t mind
We talked and we laughed
We sat real close
By the time they let us go
I was already gone

[Chorus]
Cause there was somethin&apos; &apos;bout the way
The blue lights were shinin&apos;
Bringing out the freedom in your eyes
I was too busy watching you going wild child
To be worried about going to jail
You were thinking that running for it
Would make a good story
I was thinking you were crazy as hell
But you were so innocent
But you were stealing my heart
I fell in love in the back the back the cop car

[Outro]
I fell in love in the back of a cop car (cop car)
