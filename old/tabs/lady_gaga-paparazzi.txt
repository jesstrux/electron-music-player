[Verse]

(same as 1st verse)

I&apos;ll be your girl backstage at your show

Velvet ropes and guitars

Yeah cause you&apos;re my rockstar in between the sets

Eyeliner and cigarettes

Shadow is burnt, yellow dance and return

My lashes are dry, purple teardrops I cry

It don&apos;t have a price

Loving you is Cherry Pie

&apos;Cause you know that baby I-
