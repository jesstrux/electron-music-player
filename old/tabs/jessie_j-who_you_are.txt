[Intro] 

Just a pattern. <span>A</span> <span>D</span> <span>A</span> <span>E</span> (repeat like 2 or 3 times.)


[Verse]

<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
I stare at my reflection in the mirror...
<span>A</span>          <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
Why am I doing this to myself? 
<span>A</span>          <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
Losing my mind on a tiny error, 
<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>               <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
I nearly left the real me on the shelf ... 
&quot;no,no, no, no...&quot; 


[Chorus]

<span>A</span>                   <span>D</span>   <span>A</span>                   <span>E</span>
Don&apos;t lose who you are, in the blur of the stars 
<span>A</span>             <span>D</span>                      <span>A</span>      
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing, 
<span>E</span>                     <span>A</span>
It&apos;s okay not to be okay... 
<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span> <span>A</span>                  <span>E</span>
Sometimes it&apos;s hard, to follow your heart. 
<span>A</span>                         <span>D</span>                   <span>A</span>  
Tears don&apos;t mean you&apos;re losing, everybody&apos;s bruising, 
         <span>E</span>               <span>A</span>
Just be true to who you are 
<span>A</span>  <span>D</span>   <span>A</span>  <span>E</span>
(Who you are)x11 


[Verse]

<span>A</span>            <span>D</span>                <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
Brushing my hair, do I look perfect? 
<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>             <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
I forgot what to do to fit the mould , yeah! 
<span>A</span>                   <span>D</span>          <span>A</span>      <span>E</span>
The more I try the less it&apos;s working yeah yeah yeah 
<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span>                  <span>A</span>         <span>E</span>
Cause everything inside me screams, &quot;no,no,no,no...&quot; 


[Chorus]

<span>A</span>                   <span>D</span>   <span>A</span>                   <span>E</span>
Don&apos;t lose who you are, in the blur of the stars 
<span>A</span>             <span>D</span>                      <span>A</span>      
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing, 
<span>E</span>                     <span>A</span>
It&apos;s okay not to be okay... 
<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span> <span>A</span>                  <span>E</span>
Sometimes it&apos;s hard, to follow your heart. 
<span>A</span>                         <span>D</span>                   <span>A</span>  
Tears don&apos;t mean you&apos;re losing, everybody&apos;s bruising, 
                  <span>E</span>               <span>A</span>
There&apos;s nothing wrong with who you are 


[Bridge]

<span>A</span>
Yes, no, egos 
<span>D</span>
Fake shows like woah 
<span>A</span>              <span>E</span>
Just go, and leave me alone 
<span>A</span>
Real talk real life 
<span>D</span>
Good love goodnight 
<span>A</span>                      <span>E</span>
With a smile that&apos;s my home 
            <span>A</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>A</span>  <span>E</span>
That&apos;s my home 


[Chorus]

<span>A</span>                   <span>D</span>   <span>A</span>                   <span>E</span>
Don&apos;t lose who you are, in the blur of the stars 
<span>A</span>             <span>D</span>                      <span>A</span>      
Seeing is deceiving, dreaming is believing, 
<span>E</span>                     <span>A</span>
It&apos;s okay not to be okay... 
<span>A</span>                 <span>D</span> <span>A</span>                  <span>E</span>
Sometimes it&apos;s hard, to follow your heart. 
<span>A</span>                         <span>D</span>                   <span>A</span>  
Tears don&apos;t mean you&apos;re losing, everybody&apos;s bruising, 
         <span>E</span>               <span>A</span>
Just be true to who you are
