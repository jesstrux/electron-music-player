<span>Am</span>    
A bird with the word came to me
    <span>D</span>
The sweetness of a honeycomb tree
    <span>C</span>
And now I look what&apos;s taking over me
         <span>C</span>
Couldn&apos;t fake it if I wanted to
         <span>F7</span>
I had to wake up just to make it through
         <span>F7</span>
I got my patience and I&apos;m making do
             <span>D7</span>
I learned my lessons from the ancient roots
             <span>D7</span>
I choose to follow what the greatest do
  <span>Am</span>
A bird with the word came to me
    <span>D</span>

And now I look what&apos;s taking over me
         <span>C</span>
Couldn&apos;t fake it if I wanted to
         <span>F7</span>

         <span>F7</span>

[Verse 1]
                    <span>C</span>
I&apos;m repping for the longest cycle, mmm
                 <span>C</span>
My uncles had to pay the cost, mmm
                  <span>C/A</span>
My sister used to sing to Whitney, mmm
                   <span>C/A</span>
My mama caught the gambling bug, mmm
                <span>F7</span>
We came up in a lonely castle, mmm
            <span>F7</span>
My papa was behind them bars, mmm
                <span>D7</span>
We never had to want for nothing, mmm
                 <span>D7</span>
Said all we ever need is love, mmm
           <span>Am</span>
We see the same things
            <span>D</span>
We sing the same songs
            <span>C</span>
We feel the same grief
          <span>C</span>
Bleed the same blood
                   <span>F</span>
You grew up in the home beside me
               <span>F7</span>
I always had a friend to call
                    <span>Dm7</span>
How could I make it here without you? Mmm
               <span>Dm7</span>
I pray I leave before you&apos;re gone

[Outro]
                        <span>C</span>
Hey, my little youth is crying
           <span>C</span>
I&apos;m almost home, almost home
                <span>C/A</span>
Look no further riots, mmm
           <span>C/A</span>
Working my fingers to the bone
             <span>F7</span>
See I do the best I can, mmm
           <span>F7</span>
Mama was a farmer, mmm
           <span>D7</span>
Papa was a goner, mmm
