<span>Asus2</span> &#x2013; <span>Dsus2</span>/<span>F#</span>      x 2

[Part 1]
<span>Asus2</span> &#x2013; <span>Dsus2</span>/<span>F#</span>      x 2
Lightning strikes
Inside, a chance to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain

[Part 2]
<span>Asus2</span> &#x2013; <span>Dsus2</span>/<span>F#</span>      x 2   
Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It&apos;s heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin,
No one really every wins
In heartbreak warfare

[Part 3]
<span>F#m</span> &#x2013; <span>Asus2</span> &#x2013; <span>Dsus2</span>   x 2
If you want more love,
why don&apos;t you say so?
If you want more love,
why don&apos;t you say so?

[Part 4]
<span>Fmaj7</span>/<span>G</span> &#x2013; <span>C/G</span> &#x2013; <span>G</span>     x 4
Just say so...

[Part 5]
<span>Fmaj7</span>/<span>G</span> &#x2013; <span>G</span>           x 2

How come the only way to know how high you get me
is to see how far I fall
God only knows how much I&apos;d love you if you let me
but I can&apos;t break free at all.
