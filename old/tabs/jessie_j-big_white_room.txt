[Verse]
<span>E</span>
Sitting in a big white room alone,
                                  <span>Asus2</span>  <span>A</span>
Tilt my head and feel the tears roll down.
<span>E</span>
Cause my eyes can&apos;t see in the dark,
                             <span>Asus2</span>  <span>A</span>
I feel numb, broken, and so so scared.
<span>E</span>
I don&apos;t wanna be here anymore,
I wanna be somewhere else,
     <span>Asus2</span>         <span>A</span>
Roaming free, like I used to be.
<span>E</span>
But I have to stay in this big white room,
              <span>Asus2</span>  <span>A</span>
With little old me...

[Chorus]
<span>E</span>
I&apos;m going crazy,
I&apos;m losing my mind.
<span>Asus2</span>
I&apos;m going crazy,
        <span>A</span>
In this big white room of mine.

[Verse]
<span>E</span>
Sitting in a big white room alone,
Close the door,
                         <span>Asus2</span>  <span>A</span>
Don&apos;t want the pain to come in.
(No no no no no no)
<span>E</span>
I catch my tears,
And try to stay strong.
I cry, but feel sick.
             <span>Asus2</span>         <span>A</span>
My heart is beating out of control.
<span>E</span>
Can I run more faster than you?
I wanna feel my body again,
         <span>Asus2</span>         <span>A</span>
Feel the wind in my hair, yeah.
<span>E</span>
But I have to stay in this big white room,
                 <span>Asus2</span>  <span>A</span>
Where no one else cares. (no no no no no no no oh)

[Chorus]
<span>E</span>
I&apos;m going crazy,
I&apos;m losing my mind.
<span>Asus2</span>
I&apos;m going crazy,
        <span>A</span>
In this big white room of mine.

[Bridge]
<span>E</span>
Everybody&apos;s looking at me,
Everybodys staring at me.
<span>Asus2</span>
What do I do now?
<span>A</span>
Smile. Yeah Yeah

[Chorus]
<span>E</span>
I&apos;m going crazy,
I&apos;m losing my mind.
<span>Asus2</span>
I&apos;m going crazy,
        <span>A</span>
In this big white room of mine.
