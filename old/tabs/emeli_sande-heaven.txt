Intro
<span>E</span> <span>C#m</span> <span>G#m</span> <span>F#</span>

<span>E</span>
Will you reconise me,
<span>C#m</span> 
In the flashing lights,
<span>G#m</span>
I try to keep my heart beat,
<span>F#</span> 
But I can&apos;t get it right.
<span>E</span>
Will you reconise me,
<span>C#m</span>
When I&apos;m lying on my back,
<span>G#m</span>
Somethings gone inside me,
<span>F#</span>
And I can&apos;t get it back.
