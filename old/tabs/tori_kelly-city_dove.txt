CAPO 2 (Key: A)

[Intro]

<span>G</span> | <span>Bm</span> | <span>Em</span> | <span>C</span>


[Verse 1]

<span>G</span>                               <span>Bm</span>
  I don&apos;t know what it&apos;s all about
                         <span>Em</span>
But every time I look around
            <span>C</span>
All I see is how we&apos;re holding on 
<span>G</span>                               <span>Bm</span>
  Don&apos;t ask me what&apos;s wrong or right
                      <span>Em</span>
I don&apos;t even know the time
                <span>C</span>           <span>Am</span>
All I know is I&apos;m holding on


[Pre-Chorus]

(Am)                          D
   I haven&apos;t figured anything  out
                          <span>G</span>
I haven&apos;t figured anything 
       <span>B</span> 
Anything 
        <span>C</span>
Anything  out


[Chorus]

<span>G</span>
City dove
<span>G</span>                                <span>Bm</span>
Fly between the buildings and fences
                               <span>C</span>
Soft inside but rough on the edges
                                <span>Em</span>
Waiting here for something to come
              <span>C</span>
Just holding on oh

<span>G</span>
City dove
                                  <span>Bm</span>
Fly between the stars and the headlights
                                <span>C</span>
Passing by the clouds and the street signs
                                    <span>Em</span>
Knowing that there&apos;s something to come
              <span>C</span>     <span>G</span>
Just holding on oh


[Verse 2]

<span>G</span>                        <span>Bm</span>
  I don&apos;t even know my fate
                        <span>Em</span>
I just know I&apos;m on my way
                   <span>C</span>
There will be mistakes
Moving on
<span>G</span>                          <span>Bm</span>
  I tried to get to the heart of it
                            <span>Em</span>
Fly alone and looking for heaven
    <span>C</span>                       <span>Am</span>
I know, I know I&apos;m holding on


[Pre-Chorus]

(Am)                         D
   I won&apos;t figure everything out
                         <span>G</span>
I&apos;ll never figure everything
       <span>B</span>
Everything
        <span>C</span>
Everything out


[Chorus]

<span>G</span>
City dove
<span>G</span>                                <span>Bm</span>
Fly between the buildings and fences
                               <span>C</span>
Soft inside but rough on the edges
                                <span>Em</span>
Waiting here for something to come
              <span>C</span>
Just holding on oh

<span>G</span>
City dove
                                  <span>Bm</span>
Fly between the stars and the headlights
                                <span>C</span>
Passing by the clouds and the street signs
                                    <span>Em</span>
Knowing that there&apos;s something to come
              <span>C</span>
Just holding on oh


{Instrumental]

<span>G</span> | <span>Bm</span> | <span>C</span>                              <span>Em</span>
         Waiting here for something to come
              <span>C</span>
Just holding on oh


[Chorus]

<span>G</span>
City dove
                                  <span>Bm</span>
Fly between the stars and the headlights
                                <span>C</span>
Passing by the clouds and the street signs
                                    <span>Em</span>
Knowing that there&apos;s something to come
              <span>C</span>
Just holding on oh
