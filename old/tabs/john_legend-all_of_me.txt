[Intro]

<span>Em</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span> <span>D</span>


[Verse 1] 

<span>Em</span>           <span>Cmaj7</span>                  <span>G</span>  
What would I do without your smart mouth
           <span>D</span>                      <span>Em</span>
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
          <span>C</span>            <span>G</span>               <span>D</span>          <span>Em</span>
Got my head spinning, no kidding, I can&apos;t pin you down
             <span>Cmaj7</span>                 <span>G</span>
What&apos;s going on in that beautiful mind
                <span>D</span>             <span>Em</span>
I&apos;m on your magical mystery ride
        <span>Cadd9</span>             <span>G</span>                     <span>D</span>         <span>Amadd9</span>
And I&apos;m so   dizzy, don&apos;t know what hit me, but I&apos;ll be alright


[Pre-Chorus]

   <span>Am</span>             <span>G</span>
My head&apos;s under water
    <span>D</span>              <span>Amadd9</span>
But I&apos;m breathing fine
                 <span>G</span>              <span>D</span>
You&apos;re crazy and I&apos;m out of my mind


[Chorus]

       <span>G</span>
Cause all of me
       <span>Emadd9</span>
Loves all of you
          <span>Am/C</span>
Love your curves and all your edges
           <span>C/D</span>        <span>D</span>
All your perfect imperfections
           <span>G</span>
Give your all to me
             <span>Emadd9</span>
I&apos;ll give my all to you
          <span>Am/C</span>
You&apos;re my end and my beginning
     <span>C/D</span>             <span>D</span>
Even when I lose I&apos;m winning
                  <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>   <span>Dadd9</span>
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>Dadd9</span>
And you give me all, all of you, oh


[Verse 2] 

<span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>                       <span>G</span>
How many times do I have to tell you
                 <span>D</span>                       <span>Em</span>
Even when you&apos;re crying you&#x2019;re beautiful too
              <span>C</span>           <span>G</span>          <span>D</span>                  <span>Em</span>
The world is beating you down, I&apos;m around through every mood
             <span>C</span>                 <span>G</span>
You&apos;re my downfall, you&apos;re my muse
             <span>D</span>                        <span>Em</span>
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
                <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>            <span>Am</span>
I can&apos;t stop singing, it&apos;s ringing, in my head for you


[Pre-Chorus]

   <span>Am</span>             <span>G</span>
My head&apos;s under water
    <span>D</span>              <span>Amadd9</span>
But I&apos;m breathing fine
                 <span>G</span>              <span>D</span>
You&apos;re crazy and I&apos;m out of my mind


[Chorus]

       <span>G</span>
Cause all of me
       <span>Emadd9</span>
Loves all of you
          <span>Am/C</span>
Love your curves and all your edges
           <span>C/D</span>        <span>D</span>
All your perfect imperfections
           <span>G</span>
Give your all to me
             <span>Emadd9</span>
I&apos;ll give my all to you
          <span>Am/C</span>
You&apos;re my end and my beginning
     <span>C/D</span>             <span>D</span>
Even when I lose I&apos;m winning
                  <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>   <span>Dadd9</span>
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>Dadd9</span>
And you give me all, all of you, oh


[Pre-Chorus Change]

<span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>
Cards on the table
       <span>D</span>             <span>Amadd9</span>
We&apos;re both showing hearts
<span>Am</span>       <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>
Risking it all, though it&apos;s hard


[Chorus]

       <span>G</span>
Cause all of me
       <span>Emadd9</span>
Loves all of you
          <span>Am/C</span>
Love your curves and all your edges
           <span>C/D</span>        <span>D</span>
All your perfect imperfections
           <span>G</span>
Give your all to me
             <span>Emadd9</span>
I&apos;ll give my all to you
          <span>Am/C</span>
You&apos;re my end and my beginning
     <span>C/D</span>             <span>D</span>
Even when I lose I&apos;m winning
                  <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>   <span>Dadd9</span>
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>Dadd9</span>
And you give me all, all of you, oh


[Outro]

                  <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>   <span>D</span>
Cause I give you all, all of me
                 <span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
