Capo 1

[Intro]

<span>Em</span>


[Verse]

<span>G</span>
 I knew I&apos;d see her around
                                                 <span>Em</span>
 I&apos;d be at some party, she&apos;d show up and I&apos;d be walking out
                           <span>D</span>
 Across some parking lot, hiding behind her sister
                              <span>G</span>
 I&apos;d look up, she&apos;d be at the red light beside me

 In that white maxima with the sticker on the back
                             <span>Em</span>
 I&apos;d act like I didn&apos;t see her

 And we&apos;d pay at the same pumps

 Flip through the same stations

 And slow down for the same curves
                       <span>C</span>
 Run around with the same crowds

 We just needed some time

 She could get on with her life and I&apos;d get on with mine
                      <span>D</span>
 Thought I would be fine, but maybe not

 I knew she&apos;d find a way to get over me

 But I&apos;d never thought that


[Chorus]

                <span>Em</span>                   <span>C</span>
 She would get down with somebody I know
                              <span>D</span>
 I guess that&apos;s just how it goes
                          <span>G</span>       
 When you break up in a small town
    <span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>                         <span>C</span>
 I see our friends and they put on a show
                             <span>D</span>
 Like they don&apos;t want me to know
                      <span>G</span>     <span>D</span>
 So they give me the go-around
                  <span>C</span>                        <span>G</span>
 But there&apos;s only so many streets and so many lights
                    <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>    <span>Em</span>
 I swear it&apos;s like I can&apos;t even leave my house
                           <span>C</span>
 I should have known all along
                         <span>D</span>
 You gotta move and move on

 When you break up in a small town


[Verse]

<span>G</span>
 For a while I guess they were keeping it low-key
                                                    <span>Em</span>
 And now it&apos;s like these county lines closing in on me

 I see em everywhere together

 And it&apos;s getting a little too close to home
        <span>C</span>
 She&apos;s so far gone, but she didn&apos;t go far

 She was over me before the grass grew back where she used to park her car
                      <span>D</span>
 She&apos;s leaving those same marks in someone else&apos;s yard

 In someone else&apos;s arms right down the road

 And I never thought 


 [Chorus]
               <span>Em</span>                    <span>C</span>
 She would get down with somebody I know
                              <span>D</span>
 I guess that&apos;s just how it goes
                          <span>G</span>       
 When you break up in a small town
    <span>D</span>       <span>Em</span>                         <span>C</span>
 I see our friends and they put on a show
                             <span>D</span>
 Like they don&apos;t want me to know
                      <span>G</span>     <span>D</span>
 So they give me the go-around
                  <span>C</span>                        <span>G</span>
 But there&apos;s only so many streets and so many lights
                    <span>D</span>            <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>    <span>Em</span>
 I swear it&apos;s like I can&apos;t even leave my house
                           <span>C</span>
 I should have known all along
                         <span>D</span>

[Verse]

        <span>Em</span>
 Her mailbox is seven minutes from mine
<span>C</span>                           <span>D</span>                                             <span>G</span>   
 And I drive in the town sometimes and I see her there sittin there with him
         <span>D</span>                   <span>Em</span>                             <span>C</span>        
 I want to jump out I want to fight I want to say .... that guy
                            <span>D</span>
 But I can&apos;t cause it&apos;s my fault and I let her go
   <span>G</span>          <span>D</span>
 I never thought 


 [Chorus]
                <span>Em</span>                   <span>C</span>
 She would get down with somebody I know
                              <span>D</span>
 I guess that&apos;s just how it goes
                          <span>G</span>       
 When you break up in a small town
