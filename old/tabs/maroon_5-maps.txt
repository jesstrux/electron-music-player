[Verse]

<span>A</span>           <span>B</span>           <span>C#m</span>      (riff #1)
I miss the taste of a sweeter life 
<span>A</span>          <span>B</span>      <span>C#m</span>   (riff #2)
I miss the conversation 
<span>A</span>              <span>B</span>    <span>C#m</span>
I&apos;m searching for a song tonight
<span>A</span>             <span>B</span>          <span>C#m</span>
I&apos;m changing all of the stations
<span>A</span>          <span>B</span>            <span>C#m</span>
I like to think that we had it all
<span>A</span>          <span>B</span>        <span>C#m</span>
We drew a map to a better place
<span>A</span>            <span>B</span>     <span>C#m</span>
But on that road I took a fall
<span>A</span>        <span>B</span>          <span>C#m</span>
Oh baby why did you run away?


[Chorus]

      <span>F#m</span>
I was there for you
         <span>F#m</span>
In your darkest times
       <span>G#</span>
I was there for you
          <span>G#</span>
In your darkest nights


[Verse]

              <span>A</span>          <span>B</span>
But I wonder where were you
    <span>C#m</span>
When I was at my worst
             <span>A</span>    <span>B</span>
Down on my knees
        <span>C#m</span>
And you said you had my back
             <span>A</span>          <span>B</span>
So I wonder where were you
<span>C#m</span>                                 <span>A</span>   <span>B</span>
All the roads you took came back to me
         <span>C#m</span>                            <span>A</span>
So I&apos;m following the map that leads to you
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
The map that leads to you
                    <span>A</span>
Ain&apos;t nothing I can do
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
The map that leads to you
   <span>C#m</span>                              <span>A</span>
Following, following, following to you
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
The map that leads to you
                    <span>A</span>
Ain&apos;t nothing I can do
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
The map that leads to you
  <span>C#m</span>

[Pre-Chorus]

<span>A</span>             <span>B</span>          <span>C#m</span>
I hear your voice in my sleep at night
<span>A</span>         <span>B</span>       <span>C#m</span>
Hard to resist temptation
<span>A</span>                 <span>B</span>              <span>C#m</span>
Cause something strange has come over me
            <span>A</span>        <span>B</span>   <span>C#m</span>
And now I can&apos;t get over you
            <span>A</span>         <span>B</span>  <span>C#m</span>
No I just can&apos;t get over you


[Chorus]

      <span>F#m</span>
I was there for you
         <span>F#m</span>
In your darkest times
        <span>G#</span>
I was there for you
          <span>G#</span>
In your darkest nights


[Verse]

              <span>A</span>          <span>B</span>
But I wonder where were you
    <span>C#m</span>
When I was at my worst
             <span>A</span>    <span>B</span>
Down on my knees
        <span>C#m</span>
And you said you had my back
             <span>A</span>          <span>B</span>
So I wonder where were you
<span>C#m</span>                                 <span>A</span>  <span>B</span>
All the roads you took came back to me
         <span>C#m</span>                            <span>A</span>
So I&apos;m following the map that leads to you
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
The map that leads to you
                    <span>A</span>
Ain&apos;t nothing I can do
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
The map that leads to you
   <span>C#m</span>                              <span>A</span>
Following, following, following to you
     <span>B</span>                <span>C#m</span>
