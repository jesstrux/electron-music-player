[Verse 1]

<span>C</span>                 |<span>C</span>      <span>G</span>|        <span>Am</span>        |<span>Am</span>     <span>G</span>|            
      Everybody&apos;s lookin&apos; for that something
<span>F</span>                 |<span>F</span>      <span>C</span>|       <span>G</span>      |<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>|          
      No one ever wants to pay the price
<span>C</span>                 |<span>C</span>      <span>G</span>|       <span>Am</span>       |<span>Am</span>     <span>G</span>|
      Everybody&apos;s scared of going nowhere

     <span>C</span>                |<span>C</span>    <span>G</span>|    <span>Am</span>             |<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|    <span>F</span>
     I should be more cynical and tell myself it&apos;s not okay
     <span>G</span>
     To feel this good when I&apos;m with you
     <span>C</span>              |<span>C</span>      <span>G</span>|      <span>Am</span>             |<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|      <span>E</span>
     Try my best to fight it, say I hate you, but I always stay
     <span>E</span>
     OoohOhOhOh cause


[Chorus]

  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 
  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 
  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 
  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 


[Verse 2]

<span>C</span>                 |<span>C</span>      <span>G</span>|        <span>Am</span>        |<span>Am</span>     <span>G</span>| 
      Everybody&apos;s talkin&apos; bout that next thing
<span>F</span>                        |<span>F</span>        <span>C</span>|      <span>G</span>      |<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>|  
      Feel like what they got ain&apos;t good enough
<span>C</span>                     |<span>C</span>    <span>G</span>|         <span>Am</span>       |<span>Am</span>     <span>G</span>|
      But all I wanna do&apos;s release the tension
<span>F</span>                      |<span>F</span>     <span>C</span>|      <span>G</span>     |<span>F</span>      <span>G</span>|
      Bring the conversation back to us

     I should be more cynical and tell myself it&apos;s not okay
     <span>G</span>
     To feel this good when I&apos;m with you
     <span>C</span>              |<span>C</span>      <span>G</span>|      <span>Am</span>             |<span>Am</span>  <span>G</span>|      <span>E</span>
     Try my best to fight it, say I hate you, but I always stay
     <span>E</span>
     OoohOhOhOh cause


[Chorus]

  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 
  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 
  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 
  <span>Am</span>
     Ain&apos;t nobody love, ain&apos;t nobody love like you do 


[Bridge]

<span>F</span>                                      <span>Am</span>
