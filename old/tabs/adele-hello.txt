[Intro]

<span>Em</span>  <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>C</span> 


[Verse]

   <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>    <span>D</span> <span>C</span>
Hello, it&apos;s me.
       <span>Em</span>         <span>G</span>                <span>D</span>                 <span>C</span>          <span>Em</span>  <span>G</span>     <span>D</span>    <span>C</span>
I was wondering if after all these years you&apos;d like to meet, to go over everything
               <span>Em</span>             <span>G</span>                       <span>D</span>         <span>C</span> 
They say that time&apos;s supposed to heal you, but I ain&apos;t done much healing.
  <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>    <span>C</span>
Hello, can you hear me?
       <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span>               <span>D</span>         <span>C</span>                  <span>Em</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>   <span>C</span>
I&apos;m in California dreaming about who we used to be when we were younger and free.
         <span>Em</span>        <span>G</span>                  <span>D</span>            <span>C</span>
I&apos;ve forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet.


[Pre-Chorus]

                <span>G</span>       <span>D</span>   <span>Bm</span>  <span>C</span>
There&apos;s such a difference between us
       <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>C</span>
and a million miles.


[Chorus]

<span>Em</span>          <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Hello from the other side, 
  <span>Em</span>             <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>
I must&apos;ve called a thousand times to tell you
<span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>              <span>D</span>
I&apos;m sorry, for everything that I&apos;ve done, 
            <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>
But when I call you never seem to be home.
<span>Em</span>         <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Hello from the outside,
   <span>Em</span>           <span>C</span>             <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
At least I can say that I&apos;ve tried to tell you
<span>Em</span>    <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>           <span>D</span> 
I&apos;m sorry, for breaking your heart 
                 <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>
But it don&apos;t matter, it clearly doesn&apos;t tear you apart anymore.


[Instrumental]

<span>Em</span>  <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>C</span>


[Verse]

   <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>      <span>C</span> 
Hello, how are you?  
        <span>Em</span>       <span>G</span>             <span>D</span>            <span>C</span>
It&apos;s so typical of me to talk about myself, I&apos;m sorry
   <span>Em</span> <span>G</span>            <span>D</span>     <span>C</span>
I hope that you&apos;re well
        <span>Em</span>         <span>G</span>                        <span>D</span>       <span>C</span>
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?


[Pre-Chorus]

         <span>G</span> <span>D</span>           <span>Bm</span>     <span>C</span>
It&apos;s no secret that the both of us 
     <span>G</span>      <span>D</span>      <span>C</span>
are running out of time.


[Chorus]

    <span>Em</span>          <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
So, hello from the other side, 
  <span>Em</span>             <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>
I must&apos;ve called a thousand times to tell you
<span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>             <span>D</span>
I&apos;m sorry, for everything that I&apos;ve done, 
            <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>
But when I call you never seem to be home.
<span>Em</span>         <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Hello from the outside,
   <span>Em</span>           <span>C</span>             <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
At least I can say that I&apos;ve tried to tell you
<span>Em</span>    <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>           <span>D</span> 
I&apos;m sorry, for breaking your heart 
                 <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>
But it don&apos;t matter, it clearly doesn&apos;t tear you apart anymore.


[Bridge]

<span>Em</span>  <span>C</span>  <span>D</span>  <span>G</span>


[Chorus]

    <span>Em</span>          <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
So, hello from the other side, 
  <span>Em</span>             <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>  <span>D</span>
I must&apos;ve called a thousand times to tell you
<span>Em</span>   <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>             <span>D</span>
I&apos;m sorry, for everything that I&apos;ve done, 
            <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>         <span>D</span>
But when I call you never seem to be home.
<span>Em</span>         <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>    <span>D</span>
Hello from the outside,
   <span>Em</span>           <span>C</span>             <span>G</span> <span>D</span>
At least I can say that I&apos;ve tried to tell you
<span>Em</span>    <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>           <span>D</span> 
I&apos;m sorry, for breaking your heart 
                 <span>Em</span>       <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>        <span>D</span>
But it don&apos;t matter, it clearly doesn&apos;t tear you apart anymore.
