[Intro]

<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you&#x2019;re not breaking me
<span>Em</span>                <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da Da da da 


[Verse]

<span>Em</span>   
  Somebody told me fame is a disease
  <span>Dm</span>
You start singing the blues when you start seeing the green
     <span>Em</span>   
But I think it&apos;s all about what you choose
       <span>Dm</span>
The way you live your life, depends on you
              <span>Em</span>   
That&#x2019;s when I realized I wanna make a difference
              <span>Dm</span>
Change other people&#x2019;s lives, give hope, even for a moment
   <span>Em</span>                         <span>Dm</span>
Use my name for good and change the game I could
          <span>Em</span>   
Because to make it you think I gotta act a certain way,
 <span>Dm</span>
Be a little bit insane, live a little, it&apos;s okay
    <span>Em</span>                                       <span>Dm</span>
I guess we have different definitions of living, but you&#x2019;ll twist my words anyway
  <span>Em</span>   
You&#x2019;ll say that I&#x2019;m naive, like I don&#x2019;t have a past,
           <span>Dm</span>
You&apos;re the one being deceived, I see right behind the mask
         <span>Em</span>                                     <span>Dm</span>
Tryna to stir me up and get me mad I smile because happiness is all I have


[Chorus]

<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you&#x2019;re not breaking me
<span>Em</span>             <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da, ain&#x2019;t got time for ya
<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you won&#x2019;t shatter me
<span>Em</span>                    <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile


[Verse]

<span>Em</span>                           <span>Dm</span>
   You see me hanging with my fam, 
                  <span>Em</span>   
it don&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;m living in a bubble 
                  <span>Dm</span>
You&#x2019;ll find me at church, but that don&#x2019;t mean I can&#x2019;t cause trouble
        <span>Em</span>   
So stir up a little scene cuz isn&apos;t that what you want
   <span>Dm</span>
For me to mess up, so you can dress up
             <span>Em</span>   
Some stories saying, Tori this&#x2019;ll sell more records
        <span>Dm</span>
But I&#x2019;d rather make&#x2019;em yawn than be a pawn on your chessboard
<span>Em</span>   
   So call me boring, call me cookie cutter 
            <span>Dm</span>
Or what you wanna matter of fact Just say it loud and don&#x2019;t st-stutter
<span>Em</span>                                      <span>Dm</span>
   Cuz I know who I am, I&#x2019;m still the same Just a California girl with big dreams
<span>Em</span>                                                        <span>Dm</span>
Thinking maybe they&#x2019;ll let me sing songs about real things But baby who knows 
                          <span>Em</span>   
maybe I can sell out shows without taking off my clothes
              <span>Dm</span>
God made me sexy I don&apos;t care if only I know


[Chorus]

<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you&#x2019;re not breaking me
<span>Em</span>             <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da, ain&#x2019;t got time for ya
<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you won&#x2019;t shatter me
<span>Em</span>                    <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile

<span>Em</span>     <span>Dm</span> 
Ooooooh Ooohhh  (Woh-wu woh-wu wu bua-buah)
<span>Em</span>         <span>Dm</span>
Ooooohhhhh Oh-ooohhhh 
<span>Em</span>     <span>Dm</span> 
Ooooooh Ooohhh  (Woh-wu woh-wu wu bua-buah)
<span>Em</span>         <span>Dm</span>
Ooooohhhhh Oh-ooohhhh 
and I just keep on singing

<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you&#x2019;re not breaking me
<span>Em</span>             <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da, ain&#x2019;t got time for ya
<span>Em</span>              <span>Dm</span>
La da da da dee, you won&#x2019;t shatter me
<span>Em</span>                    <span>Dm</span>
La de da da da, got an unbreakable smile
