[Intro] <span>Dm</span> <span>A</span>

[Verse 1]
<span>Dm</span>
If you could envision
                 <span>A</span>
The meaning of a tragedy 

Ooooooh
<span>Dm</span>                                <span>A</span>
You might be surprised to hear it&apos;s you and me
        <span>Dm</span>
When it comes down to it
                   <span>A</span>
You never made the most of it

Ooooooh 
<span>Dm</span>                           <span>A</span>
So I cry cry cried but now I say goodbye

[Chorus]
<span>Dm</span>                             <span>A</span>
And I won&apos;t be made a fool of
                  <span>Dm</span>
Don&apos;t call this love

<span>Dm</span> <span>A</span> <span>C</span> <span>G</span> <span>Dm</span>

[Verse 2]
<span>Dm</span>                                 <span>A</span>
When did you decide I didn&apos;t have enough to buy
                         <span>Dm</span>
Forgive and forget you a thousand times
                     <span>A</span>
For the fire and the sleepless nights

[Chorus]
<span>Dm</span>                            <span>A</span>
And I won&apos;t be made a fool of
                <span>Dm</span>    <span>A</span>
Don&apos;t call this love
      <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>
Don&apos;t call this love

[Hook]
<span>Dm</span>              <span>A</span>            
Lalalalala-love Lalalalalala-love
<span>C</span>          <span>G</span>         <span>Dm</span>
Lalalalala lalalala- love

<span>C</span>                                                          <span>Dm</span>
Why did you feel the need to prove that everybody else was right
N.C.       <span>E7</span>
No I won&apos;t fight

<span>Dm</span> <span>A</span> 

[Outro]
<span>Dm</span>              <span>A</span>          <span>C</span>
Ohhhh you&apos;re my Tragedy... Tragedy
          <span>G</span>         <span>Dm</span>
You&apos;re my Tragedy ooohh
     <span>A</span>  <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    
This is ohhh no no no no no
