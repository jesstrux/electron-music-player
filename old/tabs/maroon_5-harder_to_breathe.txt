I&apos;m sure this is the correct Key and chords     

        <span>C#m</span>                                             
      How dare you say that my behavior is unacceptable
        <span>G#</span>
      So condescending unnecessarily critical   
        <span>C#m</span>                             
      I have the tendency of getting very physical
        <span>G#</span>
      So watch your step cause if I do you&apos;ll need a miracle
        <span>C#m</span>
      You drain me dry and make me wonder why I&apos;m even here
        <span>G#</span>
      This double vision I was seeing is finally clear
        <span>C#m</span>
      You want to stay but you know very well I want you gone
        <span>G#</span>
      Not fit to funkin&apos; tread the ground that I&apos;m walking on

[Chorus]

<span>C#m</span>           <span>G#</span>                    <span>Bm7</span>             <span>F#</span>
  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
<span>C#m</span>                        <span>G#</span>           
 You&apos;ll understand what I mean when I say 
           <span>Bm7</span>                   <span>F#</span>
There&apos;s no way we&apos;re gonna give up
<span>C#m</span>                     <span>G#</span>
And like a little girl cries in the face of a 
<span>Bm7</span>                        <span>F#</span>
monster that lives in her dreams
<span>C#m</span>
Is there anyone out there cause it&apos;s getting harder and harder to breathe
(NC)
Is there anyone out there cause it&apos;s getting harder and harder to breathe


       <span>C#m</span>
      What you are doing is screwing things up inside my head
       <span>G#</span>
      You should know better you never listened to a word I said
       <span>C#m</span>
      Clutching your pillow and writhing in a naked sweat
       <span>G#</span>
      Hoping somebody someday will do you like I did


[Chorus]

<span>C#m</span>           <span>G#</span>                    <span>Bm7</span>             <span>F#</span>
  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
<span>C#m</span>                        <span>G#</span>           
 You&apos;ll understand what I mean when I say 
           <span>Bm7</span>                   <span>F#</span>
There&apos;s no way we&apos;re gonna give up
<span>C#m</span>                     <span>G#</span>
And like a little girl cries in the face of a 
<span>Bm7</span>                        <span>F#</span>
monster that lives in her dreams
<span>C#m</span>
Is there anyone out there cause it&apos;s getting harder and harder to breathe
(NC)
Is there anyone out there cause it&apos;s getting harder and harder to breathe


[Guitar Solo]
       
   
     <span>C#m</span>
Does it kill? Does it burn?
      <span>G#</span>
Is it painful to learn
         <span>Bm7</span>                   <span>F#</span>
That it&apos;s me that has all the control
        <span>C#m</span>
Does it thrill? Does it sting?
        <span>G#</span>
When you feel what I bring
        <span>Bm7</span>                      <span>F#</span>
And you wish that you had me to hold


[Chorus]

<span>C#m</span>           <span>G#</span>                    <span>Bm7</span>             <span>F#</span>
  When it gets cold outside and you got nobody to love
<span>C#m</span>                        <span>G#</span>           
 You&apos;ll understand what I mean when I say 
           <span>Bm7</span>                   <span>F#</span>
There&apos;s no way we&apos;re gonna give up
<span>C#m</span>                     <span>G#</span>
And like a little girl cries in the face of a 
<span>Bm7</span>                        <span>F#</span>
monster that lives in her dreams
<span>C#m</span>
Is there anyone out there cause it&apos;s getting harder and harder to breathe
(NC)
