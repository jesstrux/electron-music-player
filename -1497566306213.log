controllers.js:133 My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why
I got out of bed at all,
the morning rain
clouds up my window
and I can't see at all.

And even if I could
it'd all be grey
but your picture on my wall,
it reminds me
that it's not so bad,
it's not so bad.

I drank too much last night
got bills to pay
my head just feels in pain,
I missed the bus

controllers.js:133 I´m in chains, you´re in chains too
I wear uniforms, and you wear uniforms too
I´m a prisioner
You´re a prisioner too
Mr. Jailer

I have fears, you have fears too
I will die, but you self gon´die too
Life is beautiful, don´t you think so too
Mr. Jailer

I´m talking to you Jailer
Stop calling me a prisioner
Let he who is without sin -
be the first to cast the stone
Mr. Jailer
Mr. Jailer man

You supress all my strategies
You opress (wo oh oh) every part of me
What you don´t know
you´re a victim too

controllers.js:133 I can't wait 'til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going hot, so hot, just like an oven
And owww burned myself, I just had to touch it
But it's so fire and it's all mine
Hey baby, and we don't mind all the watching, ha
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozie when she does it
She's so fire tonight

And as long as I got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Now we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
...
